# Emerging Technologies 22/23
This Repository is for the Emerging Technologies assesment. Attended at ATU, on 2022/2023

# Introduction
This Github page was created from the JupyterLite template page, found here (https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo)
JupyterLite allows you to edit the notebooks make and explore python without any prior setup, any changed made will only be saved to your local machine so feel free to jump into the notebook and explore the content however you would like.

### Accessing the notebook

# Running on Local Machine
To run the Notebooks on your local machine, you will first need to install Anaconda, this is what I found worked best. Once installed you can clone the repository using
git clone https://github.com/donalBolustrom99/ET-Assement.git
to use the quantum computing notebook you will need to run the command pip install qiskit in your CMD

# Notebook Contents
This Repository contains 3 Jupyter Notebooks exploring varies concepts in computing as a whole.
The 3 Notebooks are as follows

1. Computing
2. Fourier Transforms
3. Quantum Computing

Each notebook will be explained in more detail below, and pratical and even more information can be found in the notebook themselves.

## Computing
This section explores primarily graphing in python, there are many instances of bigO representation present in the notebook. The Turing Machine is also explored in the notebook. 
### Turing Machine 
The Turing Machine is a machine invented by Alan Turing in 1936. It is a machine that reads and writes symbols. The Machine can be used to perform any calculation a computer can, we can mimic this process easily in python aswell.

## Fourier Transform
This section explores complex numbers in computing, we explore addition, multiplication and more in the notebook. We also explore these concepts in a object orientated form.
We also explore Parabolas in this section, and we create a function to make calculations with the quadratic formula.

## Quantum Computing
Quantum computing uses Qiskit (https://qiskit.org)
The Notebook explores varies gates, both single and multi-qubit states.
